# Giphy Search

A simple web site to search for gifs using Giphy. Time boxing to 4-5 hours of work.


## UX Requirements
- Pagination
- Adjust Page count 25 50 75 
- Use Search params to indicate current offset
- When clicking on a gif it should try and share it

## Bugs and Todos
 
Plenty this is a simple website and there are edge cases that are not accounted for. 
 
- The Giphy sdk couldn't be used because of use of `type="module"` in package.json field
- It's not a Responsive design and is best used on a desktop monitor
- It exposes the api key client side opening it up for abuse
- The entire repo lacks test but time boxing this didn't really allow for that.
- Needs more rich styling, animations, and a better empty state
